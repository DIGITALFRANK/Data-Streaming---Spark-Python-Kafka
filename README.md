# Data-Streaming---Spark-Python-Kafka

### Description

Tools like spark are incredibly useful for processing data that is continuously appended. The python bindings for Pyspark not only allow you to do that, but also allow you to combine spark streaming with other Python tools for Data Science and Machine learning. Let's go through the basics of using Apache Spark, as well as more advanced concepts like accumulators, combining Pyspark with Apache Kafka, using Pyspark with AWS tools like Kinesis, streaming data from sources like Twitter, and how to get the most out of the Structured Streaming paradigm in the recently-released Spark 2.3.0.
